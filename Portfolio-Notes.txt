Portfolio Notes

************ HttpURLConnection*******************************************************************************
Here I studied various websites on how HTTP connections can be done in java for andriod devices and what you can do with them.
The main source that I did for this research was http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html and
from there I was able to learn on how to connect with http urls with java in various different ways including secure connections,
cookies, and authentication sign-ons. I found other tools within the HttpURLConnection to also create a HTTP reader than can pull the
live current http file of any website. The java file is on this github at:
https://github.com/Urednick-Brandon/CIT360-Portfolio/tree/master/HTTPreader/src/httpreader
I also did a live demo of it on YouTube at (already cued up at 5m55s):

************ MVC + JUnits? + Action-Listeners?**************************************************************
I somewhat understood was MVC was and how the business, input, and display layers all work. It took me a few times to grasp the
concept, but the tutuorials at W3schools really healped: http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/mvc_intro.asp

From there I found a few more tutorials that helped build and demonstrate a live demo of a MVC and how it worked. I attempted to elevate 
the demo project and tried to make it so you can adjust the pixel size of your 'drawing', however that attempt had to be commented out
due to some compling issues that I still haven't worked out yet.

The cool thing about this demo tutorial file is that taught me about how JUnits can work and how to program something with action
listeners. I was someone familiar with action-listers when I programmed mods for World of Warcraft. The listeners wait, or constantly
check for an event to fire off, when it does, the listener tiggers and action function in response to the event. JUnits allows us to 
embed objects and values within parts of the UI that when coupled with an action-listener, will cause the view to change for us.
